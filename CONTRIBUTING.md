# Contributing
Thank you for considering contributing. Due to the relatively simple nature of the project, the main focus is on code quality and exposition. It's a great project for your first contribution.

## Appreciated Contributions
- Adding a new algorithm or data structure implementation
- Improving an existing algorithm or data structure
    - Better implementation (fewer loc, less complexity, etc.)
    - Using more appropriate variable names
- Improving problem and alogorithm descriptions


## Reporting Issues
Report bugs using the [issue tracker](https://github.com/benburk/dsa_python/issues). If an algorithm or data structure isn't working as expected, include the test case.

## Contributing
You can follow the steps [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ) to create a pull request.
```pre-commit install```

The commit message should describe an action
- add ... if you added new algorithms or data structures.
- improve merge sort (implementation|description|naming)
- fix ... if you fixed a bug
- add test(s) for ... if you wrote a test/s.
- anything else...

Attempt to add new algorithms to the appropriate folder. If you're unsure where to put it, open an issue.
